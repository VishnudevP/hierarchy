# Organization Hierarchy Visualization

## Features

- **Employee Information Display:**
  Each node represents an employee, showing their name, title, department, location, level, and various costs (management cost, IC cost, total cost).

- **Department Color Coding:**
  Different departments are color-coded to provide clear visual distinction in the hierarchy.

- **Responsive Design:** 
  Automatically centers and scrolls nodes into view when expanded.
